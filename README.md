# Hi there 👋  

## 💻 About Me  
- 🎓 Ex-**42 Angoulême** student, now studying **BUT GEII**  
- 🔧 Passionate about **low-level programming**, **algorithms**, and **system design**  
- 🐧 Exploring **Linux**, **UNIX processes**, **shells**, and **embedded systems**  
- 🎨 Also enjoy coding **fractals**, **graphics (Cub3D)**, and mathematical projects  
- 🚀 Always learning, building, and pushing my limits  

---

## 🛠️ Languages & Tools  
- **C / C++** → system programming, algorithms, low-level projects  
- **Python** → scripts, automation, math experiments  
- **Shell / Linux** → processes, signals, pipes, minishell-like projects  
- **Git & GitHub** → branching, collaboration  

---

## 📌 Projects & Interests  
- 🔹 `ft_printf` / `get_next_line` → 42 foundations  
- 🔹 `push_swap` → algorithmic optimization challenge  
- 🔹 `minishell` → parsing, signals, processes & execution  
- 🔹 `fract-ol` → fractals with interactive zoom & math  
- 🔹 `Cub3D` → raycasting & graphics in C  
- 🔹 `computor-v1` / `computor-v2` → math interpreter with equations, rationals, matrices & more
